        Hi, I'm Finn! <br>
        I'm a second years Animation student at the HKU in Utrecht, Netherlands. 
        In my animations I like to make strange worlds and creatures, completely disconnected from daily life. <br>
        Alongside my study I also like to do programming, produce music and make games.
        I have experience coding in Python, C# and HTML/CSS (I coded this website myself from scratch).
        <br><br>
        
        Software I have experience with include: <br>
        - Premiere Pro <br>
        - After Effects<br>
        - TVPaint <br>
        - Blender <br>
        - Godot <br>
        - FL Studio <br>

        <br> 
        Currently I am on looking for an internship for the upcoming academic year.
